# PassCheck

Check if your password is present in any popular wordlist

### Wordlist in use:

[SecList, all Common-Credentials](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials)

### Pending Improvements:

1. Dynamically download the wordlist, now the download is hardcoded at `get_repos.sh`
